This project is an e-commerce platform developed using Django, which enables users to browse products, manage a cart, and place orders. The platform also provides administrative functionality to manage products, view orders, and update their statuses.

Key Features:

Product Management: Users can view detailed product listings, including images, descriptions, and prices. Products are categorized for easier navigation.

Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their cart, update quantities, and view the total price before proceeding to checkout.

Order Processing: Users can place orders with different payment methods. After placing an order, they receive a summary of their purchase, including order details and status.

Order Status: The system tracks the status of each order, with options like Pending, Processing, Completed, and Failed. Admins can update these statuses directly from the admin interface.

Review System: Users can leave reviews on products they have purchased, providing feedback and ratings.

Order History: Users can view their order history, including details of each order, products purchased, and the total amount spent.

Technical Details:

Database: MySQL is used to manage data related to products, orders, users, and reviews.
Frontend: The platform features a responsive design using HTML and CSS for a seamless user experience across devices.
Admin Interface: Custom admin views and functionalities allow administrators to manage orders and update their statuses efficiently.
Challenges & Solutions:

Order Status Management: Implemented a status update feature in the admin interface, allowing for easy tracking and management of orders.
